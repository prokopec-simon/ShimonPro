    I’m a pragmatic perfectionist software developer in my twenties. I honestly
    enjoy the process of converting ideas and thoughts into custom, clean, and
    effective solutions. One of my biggest strengths is the ability to adapt
    quickly, whether it’s a specific tech stack, an existing project, or dealing
    with people. Over the years I have contributed to many OS projects,
    extending existing tools to match my specific needs, working on projects I
    enjoy, or fixing issues I come across.

    These days I focus mostly on modern web applications from start to finish. I
    can help you with every step from refining ideas, wireframing, and
    prototyping to deploying a polished and optimized application. On the other
    hand, I never turn down an interesting backend, machine learning, mobile
    app, or hardware task.
